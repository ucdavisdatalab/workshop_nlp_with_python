**Instructions**

To earn a micro-badge for this workshop, write code for/answer the prompts on 
the next page. You should do your work in a notebook environment (like Jupyter); 
include all code, code outputs, and short answers directly in your notebook.

Jupyter Notebooks, you can do this by going to `File > Save Page As` in your 
browser).
