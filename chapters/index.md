Overview
========

This three-part workshop series introduces participants to natural language
processing (NLP) with Python. It builds on our text mining series, ["Getting
Started with Textual Data"][gstd], by extending the scope of data-inflected
text analysis to include various methods of modeling meaning. Sessions will
cover NLP topics ranging from segmentation and dependency parsing to sentiment
analysis and context-sensitive modeling. We will also discuss how to implement
such methods for tasks like classification. Basic familiarity with analyzing
textual data in Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty, and
staff from a variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics to
the humanities.
