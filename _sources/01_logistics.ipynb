    "\n",
    "+ Use popular NLP frameworks in Python, including `Gensim` and `spaCy`\n",
    "+ Explain key concepts and terminology in NLP, including dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and word embedding\n",
    "+ Process texts to glean information about sentiment, subject, and style\n",
    "+ Classify texts on the basis of their features\n",
    "+ Produce models of word meanings from a corpus\n",
    "+ Perform a few core NLP tasks including keyword analysis, relation extraction, document similarity analysis, and text summarization\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Download the data that you'll need today by clicking on the following link: [https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/nlp_workshop_data/workshop_nlp_with_python_data.zip](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/nlp_workshop_data/nlp_workshop_data.zip) (note: this is a large file, it may take a while!)\n",
    "2. Un-compress the downloaded .zip file by double clicking on it\n",
    "3. Visit the Google Colab website at [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign-in using your Google account\n",
    "4. In a separate browser tab (from the one where you are logged-in to Colab) sign-in to your Google Drive\n",
    "5. Upload the `nlp_workshop_data` directory into the root of your Google Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the above steps, you will have your basic environment setup. Next, you'll need to create a \n",
    "blank notebook in Google Colab. To do this, go to Google Colab and choose \"File->New Notebook\" from the File \n",
    "Menu. Alternatively, select \"New Notebook\" in the bottom right corner of the notebooks pop-up if it appears in your window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you need to connect your Google Drive to your Colab environment. To do this, run the following code in the \n",
    "code cell at appears at the top of your blank notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from google.colab import drive\n",

    "This workshop is hands-on, and you're encouraged to code alongside the instructors. That said, we'll also start \n",
